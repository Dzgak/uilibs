---

# Beta 0.1.22

## Highlights

• **User Ownership System** → Users can now upload and manage their own libraries
• **Admin Panel Improvements** → Enhanced admin dashboard with user management
• **Image System Fixes** → Auto-sizing and centering for all images across the platform
• **Database Security** → Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
• **Permission System** → Role-based access control for library management
• **Code Cleanup** → Resolved merge conflicts and improved code structure

## New Features

### 🔐 User Ownership System
- **Library Upload**: Regular users can now upload their own libraries
- **Ownership Control**: Users can only edit/delete their own libraries
- **Admin Override**: Admins can manage all libraries in the system
- **Permission Checks**: Automatic verification of user permissions

### 🖼️ Image System Improvements
- **Auto-sizing**: Images now automatically size based on their aspect ratio
- **Centering**: All images are properly centered in their containers
- **Responsive**: Images scale appropriately on different screen sizes
- **Consistent**: Unified image handling across all components

### 🛡️ Database Security
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level protection for user data
- **User Policies**: Users can only access their own library data
- **Admin Policies**: Admins have full access to all libraries
- **Cascade Deletion**: User libraries are automatically removed when user is deleted

### 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements
- **Admin Dashboard**: Improved layout with user ownership indicators
- **Upload Button**: Available for all authenticated users (not just admins)
- **Permission Indicators**: Clear visual feedback about library ownership
- **Empty States**: Better messaging for users who haven't uploaded libraries

## Technical Improvements

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Added user_id column to libraries table
ALTER TABLE libraries ADD COLUMN user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id);

-- Added RLS policies for security
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own libraries" ON libraries
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Code Structure
- **Cleanup**: Resolved all merge conflicts in the codebase
- **Type Safety**: Updated TypeScript interfaces to include user_id
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimized image loading and rendering

### Component Updates
- **Image Viewer**: Fixed auto-sizing and centering
- **Library Cards**: Improved image display and responsiveness
- **Admin Pages**: Enhanced with user ownership features
- **Form Components**: Better validation and user experience

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
- **No Action Required**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
- **New Features**: Users can now upload their own libraries
- **Admin Access**: Admins retain full system access

### For Developers
- **Database Migration**: Run the new migration to add user_id column
- **Environment Variables**: No new environment variables required
- **API Changes**: Backward compatible with existing integrations

## Bug Fixes

- ✅ Fixed image sizing and centering issues
- ✅ Resolved merge conflicts in multiple files
- ✅ Fixed database schema inconsistencies
- ✅ Improved error handling for upload failures
- ✅ Enhanced permission checking logic

## Performance Improvements

- 🚀 Optimized image loading and rendering
- 🚀 Improved database query performance with new indexes
- 🚀 Reduced bundle size through code cleanup
- 🚀 Enhanced caching for better user experience

## Security Enhancements

- 🔒 Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- 🔒 User data isolation and protection
- 🔒 Permission-based access control
- 🔒 Secure file upload handling

## Example Usage

### Uploading a Library (User)
```typescript
// Users can now upload libraries
const { error } = await supabase.from("libraries").insert({
  name: "My UI Library",
  description: "A beautiful component library",
  user_id: user.id, // Automatically set
  // ... other fields
});
```

### Managing Libraries (Admin)
```typescript
// Admins can see all libraries with ownership info
const { data: libraries } = await supabase
  .from("libraries")
  .select("*")
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });
```

## Dependencies

- **No New Dependencies**: All changes use existing packages
- **Updated Types**: Enhanced TypeScript definitions
- **Improved Imports**: Cleaner module imports

## Future Roadmap

- 📅 Library approval workflow for admins
- 📅 User profile management
- 📅 Advanced search and filtering
- 📅 Library versioning system
- 📅 Community features and ratings
